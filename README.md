🛒 Amazon-Style E-Commerce Website
📌 Project Overview

This project is a JavaScript-based e-commerce website inspired by Amazon’s core features. It simulates an online shopping platform where users can browse products, add items to a cart, and manage their shopping experience in a clean, responsive interface.

The website was built as part of my coursework at Georgia Gwinnett College, demonstrating practical application of front-end development skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
